    "    - What It Means: The average HR starts low (approximately 85-140 bpm) and rises steadily as workouts begin. The “skinniness” suggests most workouts follow a similar warmup pattern - HR increases predictably across the 59 sessions.\n",
    "    - Professor Brooks: Your warmups are rock-solid consistent! Your HR typically climbs smoothly during the first 15 minutes of your workouts.\n",
    "- **15–35 Minutes: Peak Effort Zone (Moderate Variance, Aerobic/Cardio Zone with Max HR)**\n",
    "    - The line “widens” as HR rises to the maximum and/or plateaus (around the 140–150 bpm range), but with greater fluctuation than the preceeding 15 minutes. The high-effort phase—HR hits its max as workouts reach full intensity, with some sessions pushing to 150 bpm, while others hovering lower. This could mean workouts start diverging; some workouts ramp up faster, others plateau, depending on intensity or type.\n",
    "    - Professor Brooks: Here’s your peak zone, 15–35 minutes, where your HR tops out around 140–150 bpm (putting you in the aerobic/cardio zone), and the line \"widens\" a bit. You’re cranking it up, but with some diversity in how hard each session hits. Your workouts appear to start to split; some push harder, others ease off, showing variety in how you build effort.\n",
    "- **35–45 Minutes: Slow Decrease (High Variance, Slow Decrease)**\n",
    "    - A very slight decrease in HR begins as workouts start easing off, but with more variability as some drop faster than others.\n",
    "    - Professor Brooks: From 35–45 minutes, your HR slides from approximately 135 to 120 bpm, and a slow wind-down from aerobic/cardio to the fat-burning zone kicks in. This transition period showing greater variance, showing some workouts cool off quicker than others while you continue to push.\n",
    "- **45–65 Minutes: Plateau (High Variance)**\n",
    "    - A steady average hides huge swings: some workouts dip to 103 bpm, others spike to 150 bpm, creating that “tall static” look.\n",
    "    - Professor Brooks: As the data plateaus around 120 bpm, but the range is wild — 103 to 150 bpm! The tall static indicates the great variance in workout intensity at the 45-65-minute mark. This is a great low-intensity/fat-burning zone to plateau in.\n",
    "- **65–85 Minutes: Late-Game Surge (High Variance, Increase)**\n",
    "    - A surprising late surge! Workouts that make it to 65-85 minutes appear to ramp up again, with big variability (that “static” persists). The 75–85 stretch narrows slightly as HR trends upward more consistently.\n",
    "    - Professor Brooks: From 65–85 minutes, it’s a comeback! Your HR climbs from around 110 to 140 bpm. Could this be where you find your second wind? The variance continues as some long workouts surge later than others, though it narrows a bit toward the end. The \"narrowing\" may be due to fewer workouts making it to this point.\n",
    "- **85+ Minutes: Very Narrow (Extremely Low Variance, Very Rare Long Workouts)**\n",
    "    - Only a few workouts reach this far, and their HRs cluster tightly, with very little room for variation due to so few data points.\n",
    "    - Professor Brooks: Past 85 minutes, we see very little variance in your workouts as only your longest sessions reach this point.\n",

    "### Future Notes\n",
    "One thing I do notice that might benefit from further data analysis is how the professor cools down. The line graph above shows us some great data for his warm-ups; but it may also be just as important to understand how the professor cools down from his workouts, as cool downs gradually help us return our body to a resting state. This also prevents injury, and promotes recovery by gradually lowering heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, while also aiding in muscle recovery and relaxation [https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20045517].\n"

    "## Did Professor Brook's Heart Health or Exercise Routine Improve?\n",
    "### A Scatter Plot with a Linear Trend Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a better idea of what the professor's workouts typically look like, we can investigate further to get a better idea of the *improvement* the professor may have experienced during these months. Thus, my first follow-up chart is to address whether Professor Brooks' heart health improved over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we can see how the professor's **average heart rate** during workouts changes over time (across all 59 workouts with heart rate readings). This could indicate improvements in fitness (lower average HR over time) or changes in workout intensity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it makes sense to generate another line graph for a time-based graph, I don't believe this is the best way to approach our new graph. The reason being that we deduced earlier that Professor Brooks sometimes completes more than 1 workout in a day. This means that a standard line graph connecting points chronologically might create misleading jumps or trends (especially noticeable on days when the professor does a variety of low-intensity and strenuous workouts). Thus, the connection of the points could obscure the true progression over time and confuse the readers (especially with perfectly vertical lines in our graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "I sought to address this issue by, instead, generating a scatterplot with a trend line. A **linear Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression** is one of the most basic trend lines we can fit to our data. However, a quick search on `Plotly` produced another type of trend line called a **Locally WEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS) trendline**. The LOWESS trend line fits a **smooth curve** to scatterplots, and allows us to capture non-linear trends. I thought that this would be a useful addition to our data, so I followed Plotly's page to add the LOWESS trend line [https://plotly.com/python/linear-fits/].\n"

This increase could mean your building strength or endurance; but it may also hint at other confounding variables (e.g., less recovery or external factors (e.g., increase in summer heat (July-August is the hottest time of the year in Michigan) or increases in stress/cortisol -- but these would have had to continue throughout July-October)."

However, the Fat-Burning Zone’s lower total (11.46 hours) indicates less of an emphasis on sustained fat utilization, which could be key for weight loss goals [if that aligns with the professor's goals].\n",

    "    - July’s HR distribution is compact and centered in the Fat-Burning Zone, suggesting a consistent intensity level across recorded running or cycling sessions. The narrow spread (15 bpm between Q1 and Q3) indicates low variability. The max HR (155 bpm) dipping into the Aerobic/Cardio Zone suggests occasional bursts, possibly brief accelerations or inclines, but these are outliers in what appears to be a consistent demonstration of moderate-intensity exercise.\n",

    "    - August marked a clear shift to higher-intensity efforts in intense cardio. The wider Q1-to-Q3 spread and overall higher HRs suggest more variability, possibly mixing tough workouts with lower-intensity periods (min: 69 bpm). August is also one of the hottest months of the year. If we were to consider that a significant portion of these exercises took place outside (which we will begin to explore in [Part 3] of this project), then the additional heat-related stress could also be increasing the professor's overall HR. Outside of the heat, the aerobic/cardio dominance could also indicate a push in fitness level, a change in routine, or perhaps the presence of workouts that don't incorporate as much cooldown times.\n",

    "    - September continues with the aerobic/cardio focus but softens a bit; it is overall less extreme than August (lower max HR), with some moderate activity creeping in. This might suggest a balance between pushing cardio limits and sustained efforts at a lower HR, or a natural taper after August’s intensity [, perhaps due to the cooling weather].\n",

    "    - October’s single day (Oct. 3) leans hard into an intense, aerobic/cardio-centered workout. The tight distribution around 140 bpm suggests a focused, intense session. It's important to note that the sample size limits broader conclusion about the month of October.\n"

    "Professor Brooks, the 59 workouts we worked with weave a cohesive and exciting story across our three simple graphs, showcasing your summer 2019 fitness journey with clarity and depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line graph profiled what your typical workout sessions look like:\n",
    "- Warm-ups take around 20 minutes to ramp your heart rate to 140 bpm—a steady build.\n",
    "- Your peak heart rate (~150 bpm) hits between 20–30 minutes, showing a strong push.\n",
    "- Between 30–45 minutes, your heart rate eases to ~125 bpm, a controlled descent.\n",
    "- You catch a second wind at 45 minutes, steadily climbing until the end\n",
    "\n",
    "The scatter plot with linear OLS regression tracked your average HR rising from 120 to 145 bpm from July to October, signaling workouts growing in intensity over these months. The LOWESS trendline spiked mid-summer, peaking in August —- likely the summer heat amping up cardiac stress, pushing your average HR higher. This visual layered regression to spotlight that mid-summer intensity surge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The violin plots (upgraded from the simple histogram) deconstructed your heart rate distributions by month, revealing where your efforts landed across zones:\n",
    "- July’s exercises clustered in the fat-burning zone (106–126 bpm)\n",
    "- August shifted hard into the aerobic/cardio zone (126+ bpm); this is your peak effort month\n",
    "- September dialed back slightly but stayed mostly in the aerobic/cardio zone\n",
    "- October ramps up again, though with only one workout, monthly generalizations shouldn't be made"

    "1. If you would like to focus on heart health:\n",
    "> We can see from the data that you’re already a cardio champ, especially in August! To keep boosting your cardiovascular endurance, you can continue to lean into those longer workout sessions (where your HR often hits 140+ bpm), sustaining 30–45 minutes in the aerobic/cardio zone (126–150 bpm). Your \"second wind pattern\" shows that you have late game stamina; knowing that can help you push through the plateau and back into your aerobic/cardio zone by around Minute 70.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you would like to focus on fat reduction:\n",
    "> July’s fat-burning focus (106–126 bpm) was spot-on! You could revisit that with more of the exercises that you completed during that month. Keeping your HR steady at 110–120 bpm would be crucial for this. You can mix in some August-style intensity (short cardio bursts) to keep things interesting, but prioritize duration in the fat-burning zone over the aerobic/cardio zone. The data shows you have great stamina in the aerobic/cardio zone (which is very difficult to do!), so keeping your HR steady with a lower intensity workout will likely be not too challenging for you."
