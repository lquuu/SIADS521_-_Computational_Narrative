    "## A Comparison of Running & Cycling\n",
    "One aspect of the data that we have yet to explore is the type of exercise Professor Brooks was doing throughout the summer.\n",
    "- Deepti Wilson (Tuesday at 10:41 PM) stated that, \"The only type of recorded exercises are biking and running.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, it would be interesting to see any discrepancies in Professor Brooks' heart rate with respect to the type of exercise. For this graph, I will be working under the assumption that each datafile (i.e., each individually recorded workout) will be *either* running *or* cycling. The reason being that it would be somewhat strange for one to bike, leave their bike somewhere, and run away from their bike (unless, perhaps, someone was training for a triathlon?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to work under the mutually exclusive assumption, then we could categorize individual workouts (i.e., datafiles) as running or cycling by calculating the **maximum** `enhanced_speed` of a datafile. The reason we would use the `enhanced_speed` column over the `speed` column is simply due to the significant lack of NaN values.\n",
    "- As seen in Part 1, `speed` had an NaN percentage of approximately 63.28%, while `enhanced_speed` had an NaN percentage of approximately 0.025%.\n",
    "To clarify the difference between the two, I attended office hours with Erik Lang on March 29, 2025, where we discussed possible differences.\n",
    "- `enhanced_speed` typically refers to a more precise measurement of one's speed compared to basic speed measurements (i.e., `speed`). This is because `enhanced_speed` takes into account GPS data, accelerometer data, elevation changes, and even heart rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some research, it appears that, for an average person:\n",
    "- a typical running speed is around 5-8 mph (~ 2.2-3.8 m/s)\n",
    "- a typical cycling speed for beginners starts around 10-15 mph (~ 4.47-6.7 m/s)\n",
    "    - We will also be making the assumption that, because Professor Brooks is cycling for exercise, that the bicycle will not be powered electrically [thereby increasing cycling speed]\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there can be a lot of overlap between the two speeds, so it becomes crucial to find a speed in which it is nearly impossible to run, but easily attainable for cyclists. With some research, I believe this number to be approximately 13 mph.\n",
    "- Elite marathon runners can average speeds around 13 mph long-distance, but this is very difficult to achieve for the average person.\n",
    "- 13 mph is very easily attainable cycling\n",
    "\n",
    "We were given information in the assignment that the units are in m/s, thus our cut-off will be 5.81152 m/s.\n"

    "In one way, it was a *very* trying process because it required a lot of self-reflection and self-evaluation along the way. I questioned myself quite a lot, especially my underlying assumptions—like whether enhanced_speed or cadence could cleanly split Running and Cycling. Each debug step forced me to rethink: why was I categorizing this way? Was the data lying to me? It helped me better understand not just what I was doing, but *why* and *how*. In hindsight, I learned I should’ve tackled this deeper dive earlier, perhaps in Part 1, instead of chasing a “big picture” at the end. Starting small and iterating would’ve saved some late-night head-scratching!\n",

    "1. **Cycling-Only Revelation**: Discovering that all the HR data from July–October 2019 reflects Cycling workouts reframes our simple charts from Part 2. The line graph’s warmup-to-surge profile, the scatter plot’s 120–145 bpm rise with an August spike, and the violin plots’ monthly zone shifts (July in Fat-Burning, August in Aerobic/Cardio)—these all describe your cycling prowess, not a mix of activities. This sharpens their relevance: you’re a cycling master! But this is a double-edged sword: these insights don’t touch running, leaving a gap in understanding your full fitness picture.\n",
    "2. **Data Expansion Needed**: To dig deeper into your workouts and cardio improvement, we’d need more measurements. The Garmin cadence sensor nailed your cycling, but Running data is missing—perhaps untracked or lost in Strava’s merge. Adding run-specific metrics (e.g., via a watch or Garmin Foot Pod for step cadence) would let us compare effort across activities.\n",
    "3. **Cycling Strengths & Next Steps**: With cycling as your go-to workout, the ridgeline plot with heart rate zones highlights your cycling capabilities: July’s steady Fat-Burning rides (106–126 bpm) built endurance; August’s Aerobic/Cardio peaks (140+ bpm) pushed intensity (likely heat-driven); September eased off, and October came roaring back.\n"
